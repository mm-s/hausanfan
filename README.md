## Description

hausanfan falls into the following category:
*Challenges associated with real-time communication and translation*

Communication via webcam could be hard for those who don't find a peer to train with. By entering hausanfan he/she could easily sin in front a webcam and try to decode which english words a fake remote peer is saying under quite the same stressing conditions of a real world communication thus being possible to refine his/her teleworking skills.
It also serves as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a> trainer for those males who wanted to be more succesful picking girls in the disco simply by changing the url of the default fake video.
