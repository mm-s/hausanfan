## Description

hausanfan falls into the following category:
*Challenges associated with real-time communication and translation*

Communication via webcam could be hard for those who don't find a peer to train with. By entering hausanfan he/she could easily face a webcam trying to understand a pre-recorded remote peer under quite the same stressing conditions of a real world communication with a real human, thus being possible to refine his/her teleworking skills.
It also serves as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">NLP</a> trainer for those males who wanted to be more succesful picking girls in the disco simply by changing the url of the default fake video.
It serves as well to more brilliant developers who want to fork it and improve it, which should be an easy peasy task.
